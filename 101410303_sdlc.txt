Why DevOps is important in making software

1. DevOps Speeds Up Software Delivery
DevOps plays a critical role in accelerating software delivery by enabling continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). It allows development and operations teams to work together efficiently, automating much of the software lifecycle. By reducing manual processes and integrating automated testing and deployment, DevOps ensures faster release cycles without sacrificing quality, allowing businesses to stay competitive and meet customer demands.
