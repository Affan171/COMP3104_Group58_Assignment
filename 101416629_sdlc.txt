Learning DevOps is crucial in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) because it fosters collaboration between development and operations teams, ensuring faster and more efficient delivery of software. By automating processes such as testing, integration, and deployment, DevOps reduces the risk of human error, leading to higher quality and more reliable software. It also promotes continuous feedback and iterative improvements, allowing teams to respond quickly to changes and user demands. In addition, DevOps practices enhance scalability, security, and monitoring, ensuring that applications perform well in production environments. Overall, DevOps streamlines the development process, making it more agile and adaptive.
